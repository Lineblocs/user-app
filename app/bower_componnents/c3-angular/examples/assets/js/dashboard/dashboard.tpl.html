        <p>Welcome to the tutorial for using the c3js angular directives. We created these directives to make it easier to
            integrate graphs in your AngularJS project.</p>

        <h2>Installation</h2>

        <p>If you want to run this tutorial you have to run this as a website. There are a few ways you can do this. For all
            means you have to get a copy from this <a href="https://github.com/jettro/c3-angular-directive">github
                repository</a>. You can download the zip/tar or clone the repository.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using Python: Step into the examples folder and run <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000</code></li>
            <li>Using grunt: From the root run: <code>grunt devserver</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Setting up your project</h2>

        <p>Before you can show your graphs, you need to do the boilerplate stuff. You have to create an html page that loads the
            appropriate javascript libraries and stylesheets. The next code block shows this very basic html page.</p>

<pre class="brush: xml; highlight: [5, 15]; html-script: false">
&lt;html lang="en" ng-app="graphApp">
&lt;head>
&lt;link href="assets/css/c3.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body ng-controller="GraphCtrl">

    &lt;script src="assets/js/d3.min.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
    &lt;script src="assets/js/c3.min.js">&lt;/script>
    &lt;script src="assets/js/angular.min.js">&lt;/script>
    &lt;script src="assets/js/c3-angular.min.js">&lt;/script>

    &lt;script src="assets/js/app.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>

</pre>

        <p>Besides the html we also need a bit of JavaScript to initialize the application. The next code block shows
            initilizing the app and a controller.</p>
<pre class="brush: js; ruler: true;">
var graphApp = angular.module('graphApp', ['gridshore.c3js.chart']);

graphApp.controller('GraphCtrl', function ($scope) {

});
</pre>
        <p>That is it, before we move on to your first graph lets have a look at the different directives that are available.
            The main element is <em>c3chart</em>. All other directives are children of this element. This directive has a few
            attributes to configure the chart. The most important attribute is the <em>bind-id</em>, if you want multiple graphs
            on one page, this has to be unique. Other attributes are <em>padding-top/right/left/bottom</em>,
            <em>show-labels</em>, <em>show-subchart</em> and <em>enable-zoom</em></p>
